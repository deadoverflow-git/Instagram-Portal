# Instagram portal
Instagram portal is a Chrome Extension which allows you to view images sent by other users without them knowing that you have opened it.
## How to install
This is not an official extension so to load it into chrome you must turn on "Developer mode", then click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where these two files are located. 
Now next time once You open instagram chats, you will see a button "Open Anon Portal"
## Updates
There will be updates so I strongly advise you follow me here to get to know when new updates are out. I plan to work on it a bit more so make sure you stay up to date.
